    <h2 class="typer">Global Startup Fest</h2>
    <p class="projdes">Global Startup Fest 2022 is an event that was co organised by Ngee Ann Polytechnic and SWITCH (Singapore) as a platform to connect students to global startup founders and industry players to exchange ideas and access market knowledge. 
<br>
<br>
BUZK was awarded the project to be the main designer to conceptualise and design the event logo(which will be continually used on an annual basis), a digital poster, 8 email newsletter and 14 Instagram posts and stories for publicity purposes.

The logo that you see on the left went through 6 different iterations before it was finalised. The logo design was carefully conceptualised with the brand colors and structure in mind. The idea of toying with vector text was implemented to give a visual and feeling of “building blocks”, which is the essence of startups and this event in general; to provide a platform for budding startups to learn and grow.

     A total of 8 EDMs were designed by us for GEI to send out email newsletters to potential participants to encourage signups for the event. The newsletter was design with specific focus on 2 objectives, which are to encourage click through rate and convey information succinctly. 
<br>
<br>
We explored with white space around and kept the overall design minimal using solids of varying opacity in the background. After working out a clear structure of content placement, we came up with a simple design of the each header to grab the reader's attention. Important information such as headers and titles are boxed out to pull user focus. This design is standardised throughout the other EDMs we created for consistency and branding purposes.
